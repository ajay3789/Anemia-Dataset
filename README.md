Dataset Overview:
The dataset appears to be a tabular clinical dataset with hematological attributes measured from complete blood count (CBC) tests. These features are crucial in diagnosing different types and severities of anemia.

ðŸ“Œ Key Features Explained:
1. Hemoglobin (Hgb)
â€¢	Definition: A protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body.
â€¢	Normal Range:
o	Men: 13.8 to 17.2 g/dL
o	Women: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL
â€¢	Role in Anemia: Low hemoglobin is the primary indicator of anemia. Different thresholds define mild, moderate, or severe anemia.

2. Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH)
â€¢	Definition: The average mass of hemoglobin per red blood cell (RBC), calculated as:
MCH=HemoglobinRBC count(pg/cell)\text{MCH} = \frac{\text{Hemoglobin}}{\text{RBC count}} \quad (\text{pg/cell})MCH=RBC countHemoglobin(pg/cell) 
â€¢	Normal Range: 27 to 33 picograms
â€¢	Clinical Relevance:
o	Low MCH: Microcytic anemia (e.g., iron deficiency)
o	High MCH: Macrocytic anemia (e.g., B12/folate deficiency)

3. Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC)
â€¢	Definition: The concentration of hemoglobin in a given volume of packed red blood cells.
MCHC=HemoglobinHematocrit(g/dL)\text{MCHC} = \frac{\text{Hemoglobin}}{\text{Hematocrit}} \quad (g/dL)MCHC=HematocritHemoglobin(g/dL) 
â€¢	Normal Range: 32 to 36 g/dL
â€¢	Clinical Relevance:
o	Low MCHC: Hypochromic anemia (common in iron deficiency)
o	High MCHC: Spherocytosis, or falsely elevated due to cold agglutinins

4. Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV)
â€¢	Definition: The average size (volume) of red blood cells, calculated from hematocrit and RBC count.
MCV=HematocritRBC countÃ—10(fL)\text{MCV} = \frac{\text{Hematocrit}}{\text{RBC count}} \times 10 \quad (fL)MCV=RBC countHematocritÃ—10(fL) 
â€¢	Normal Range: 80â€“100 femtoliters
â€¢	Clinical Relevance:
o	Low MCV (<80): Microcytic anemia
o	High MCV (>100): Macrocytic anemia
o	Normal MCV: Normocytic anemia
